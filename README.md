This is the solution for a Code Challenge I received. It has two main responsabilities, the firstone is to show a formulary where the user must set some parameters, in order to retrieve a value that depends on them. The value is received asyncronously and has to be shown with special format, according to the payment frecuency that can be  set dinnamicly.

The second part of this application consists in a JSON REST method that returns the premium mentioned before according the parameters passed by GET HTTP query string.
